My program supports every instruction in the specifications with no known issues. In addition to this, my program also
supports the beq instruction which was implemented for ease of using the provided original test cases. In addition to
the test cases provided, I used the attached files: branch.asm, zeroes.asm, iTypes.asm, rTypes.asm, and jump.asm.
